# dog-program
This repo contains a simple program where you can create dogs and users (who can be owners of dogs), and allows you to hold auctions for dogs where users can place bids.  
The program was written as part of an assignment in the first ever programming course I took, around May 2019.  
You can interact with the program through the console, by writing commands. The following commands are available:  
- "Register new dog": Allows you to create a new dog by specifying name, age, breed and weight.  
- "Increase age": Allows you to increase the age of a dog.  
- "List dogs": Lists the dogs currently in the register, sorted by tail length.
- "Remove dog": Allows you to remove a dog from the register. 
- "Register new user": Allows you to create a new user.
- "Give dog": Allows you to give a dog to an existing user. 
- "List users": Lists each user and the dogs they own, if they own any. 
- "Remove user": Allows you to remove a user, which also removes any dogs that the user owns. 
- "Start auction": Allows you to start an auction for a dog. 
- "Make bid": Allows you to make a bid on an auction, on behalf of a specified user. 
- "List auctions": Lists the ongoing auctions. 
- "List bids": Lists the current bids for an auction. 
- "Close auction": Closes the specified auction, awarding the dog to the user with the highest bid. 
- "Exit": Exists and closes the program.
